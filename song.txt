Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
